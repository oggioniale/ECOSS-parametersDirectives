*ECOSS Tools* are part of the implementation work done in the framework
of the [Interreg Italy-Croatia project
ECOSS](https://www.italy-croatia.eu/) WP5 - Design and implementation of
data infrastructure.

*ECOSS Tools* aims at providing interactive applications to respond to
the needs of the sites involved in the [ECOlogical observing system in
the Adriatic Sea (ECOAdS)](https://ecoads.eu) for what concerns
conservation strategies and the contribution to the main EU directives.
The ECOSS Tools provide graphical representations of monitoring
activities at the sites, leveraging the information collected by the
ECOSS project by means of their integration with other information
sources already available in internet.

ECOAdS includes two types of sites: Long Term Ecological Research (LTER)
and Natura 2000 (N2K) sites, belonging to the [LTER
network](https://www.lter-europe.net/lter-europe) and the Natura 2000
network\](<https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/awards/natura-2000-network/index_en.htm>),
respectively.

*ECOSS Tools* allow to:

1.  Evaluate the LTER-and-N2K sites’ contribution to the Marine Strategy
    Framework Directive (MSFD) monitoring activities (**Directive
    contribution**);

2.  Evaluate the N2K sites’ contribution to the conservation of the
    specific target species and habitats included in the site
    (**Conservation strategy**).

*ECOSS Tools* can be reached starting from the ECOAdS portal, directly
from the map on the HomePage, by accessing each sites page (e.g. [Cres -
Lošinj
page](https://ecoads.eu/site/2e6014fe-8f3b-4127-8ab1-405ae1303281/))
trough the “Tools” section.

The **site contribution** tab contains the tool for the assessment of
the site contribution of the site to MSFD. Within this tool it is
possible to visualize the measured parameters and their relation with
MSFD criteria elements. The **conservation strategy** tab contains the
tool showing the contribution of the N2K site to the conservation of
target species and habitats.

The site contribution is evaluated by the number of observed parameters,
corresponding to the parameters suitable for assessing a MSFD criteria.
The conservation strategy contribution is evaluated by comparing the
number of ecological, oceanographic, and pressure variables measured at
the site with the variables indicated by ECOSS as fundamental for
assessing the state of conservation of the specific target
species/habitat.

During the ECOSS project, great effort was devoted both to identify the
parameters to be monitored in order to accomplish the MSFD criteria
needs and to recognize the variables that better contribute to
conservation strategies. The results of this work are delivered in the
following documents and publications:
